# Bash-Scripts | Author: Frothy-Hax | Original Date: 17/02/2022
#
# This repo will hold bash scripts with a focus on automation
# Most of these scripts will be based around network reconnaisence, making use of tools that come as a standard with Kali Linux
# The idea of this repo is to build up a set of tools that can perform non-damaging recon against a target and output the results to file
# I want to develop two kinds of tools in this repo, one that requires input of target data directly into the tool itself and one that can grab target data from a file
# The aim it to have one set of tools that can be ran ad hock for specific reasons, and one set that can be used to perform automated monthly recon
# Long term I want to get the monthly recon scripts to output the data into some sort of report that can be passed to an organisation to review their security posture

# Any comments or suggestions are welcome!
